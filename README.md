## RGBT-detection

Our code is built based on [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2).

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Datasets

We use unaligned RGB-thermal [FLIR dataset](https://www.flir.com/oem/adas/adas-dataset-form/) and aligned [KAIST dataset](https://soonminhwang.github.io/rgbt-ped-detection/).

For our code released, we first release codes to run on FLIR.

## Usage

Please follow the [README.md](demo/README.md) in demo.
